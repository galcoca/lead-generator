- Changed if n = 0 to if n == 0 to properly check for equality.
- Modified the Fibonacci function to return an empty list for non-positive n and return [0] when n is 1.
- Corrected the initial values of the Fibonacci sequence to [0, 1].
- Fixed the range in the Fibonacci loop to range(2, n) to generate correct Fibonacci sequence of length n.
